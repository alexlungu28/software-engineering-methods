# Meeting notes week 5 (Alex Maat)

## Our Questions

-   Failing pipelines due to too many connections
    -   Disconnect when final pipeline is running
    -   We can use amazon, but dont commit config file

## Feedback

-   Documentation
    -   Good improvements; fixed a lot of mentioned issues
    -   Good job at retrospectives
    -   Missing reflection at the end of retrospective 4 (fix this in week 5, and can also fix in week 4)
        -   What is improved vs last week
        -   How to improve next week
-   Testing
    -   Focus on mocks, and unit tests
    -   Aim for at least 30%, 40%
    -   Prioritize different types of testing
-   Code quality
    -   Generally good
    -   Some responses donâ€™t return JSON: fix those
    -   A lot of properties that contain url to other microservice: have central config file with these urls
    -   Folder structure sometimes inconsistent
    -   Remove sysoutprints
    -   Some methods are too large (esp. In controllers)
    -   Split into diff methods, or diff classes

## Last Sprint

-   Make this last retrospective the best one
-   Personal documents can also be added to docs folder (of final sprint)
