# Notes â€“ Meeting Week 4 (Michel Bulten)

- Did not think the teacher should not influence the room size in the room scheduler, said it would be better if the Room Scheduler schedules the lectures to rooms based on a sorted list of courses(sorted on student size) and room size. Allocate the largest room to the largest course etc.
- We should push the reports from the previous 4 weeks. this includes checktyle and PMD where applicable and Sprint retrospectives.
- Work should be more evenly contributed.
- Code quality is very important and should be better.
- We also should document our code more, especially the algorithms.
