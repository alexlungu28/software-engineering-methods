# Notes â€“ Meeting Week 1 (Nikolaos Efthymiou)
- The meeting in week 1 was mostly about getting to know the other team members and working on the requirements of the application.
- Creation of issues on GitLab for some initial tasks
- Agreed upon the way we will work on meeting agendas and taking meeting notes:
    - For every meeting agenda (starting from week 2), there will be a note taker and a chair.
    - The chair will be the one that was the note taker in the previous week.
    - These roles will rotate every week.
    - This way all team members contribute equally to the above-mentioned process.
- Agreed upon the way we will work on GitLab:
    - Each task will have its own branch (branching out of master)
    - Once the task it completed, a merge request  will be made for merging the branch into master (two other team members needed to approve the request)
- After the meeting with the TA, when the application and the overall requirements were introduced, time was spent within the team to further think and elaborate on the requirements. We came up with some questions (_requirements_questions.md_) that can be found on GitLab under the _docs_ folder (where all the documents regarding the project requirements, the meeting agendas, the meeting notes etc. will be stored)
